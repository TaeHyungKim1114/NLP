# Onboarding Project 1

Goal: Summarize the Transformer paper

To-do
1. Set up OpenAI Account and get api key value
2. Set it in the .env file or in main.py as openai.api_key
3. get the transfomer variable from the ./data folder
4. set the prompt accordingly to get the api to summarize the given paper
5. the transformer variable is too long for the api to process in one try. Split it in your own way and experiment.
6. Call the api with the prompt and the context (portion of the trasnformer string) and get the summary
7. Merge the summary in your own way. Experiment for better algorithms.
8. print the final summary result and save it separately in Google Docs or in a memo app
9. Try to improve the algorithm and try different methods.
10. Dicuss with your teammates regarding the results and algorithms and collectivelly try to find a better way to summarize the paper
11. commit and push the code to GitHub continuously

Presentation
1. Save the final summary result (Google Docs, Memo app)
2. Push the final code to GitHub
3. List the methods discussed among teammates and ways to improve the algorithm
